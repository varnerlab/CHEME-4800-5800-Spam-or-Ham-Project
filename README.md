# CHEME-4/5800 Ham or Spam Project Template
Template repository for the spam or ham prediction problem. One of the challenges of our modern existence is telling which messages, e.g., texts, emails, phone calls, etc., are real and which are fake.  Using a labeled public text message data set (which may contain some NSFW/offensive content), design and implement a program to classify text messages as spam (fraudulent) or ham (legitimate). This is a classical solved as a binary classification problem, where we learn the model parameters for a classifier from our training data, i.e., we use a supervised learning approach that maximizes the likelihood of a correct spam or ham classification. To test your system, split the data into training and test sets and compute the probability of an accurate prediction on the test data set.

### Data
The text message data was taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Lab](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?select=spam.csv).
